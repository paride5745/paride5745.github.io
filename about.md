Hello Internet, my name is Paride (pronunciation IPA: /Ëˆpa.ri.de/ ), I am Italian, living in Berlin.

I work as a Linux System Engineer, I am a Linux user since 2000 (first distro Mandrake Linux 7.1), and I am a Linux professional since 2007. I started to work as DevOps since 2016, adopting tools such as Ansible, Docker and Kubernetes. I specialize in Linux system administration, infrastructure management, and custom tool development using Go. My technical expertise covers several areas: GoLang, Linux, Container Technologies, and cloud platforms. Currently, I am enriching my technical skills by improving my GoLang knowledge and learning more about Backend development techniques. I am starting to learn Rust lately, as I see it becoming more and more important in my areas of interest (systems engineering, cloud computing, and backened engineering).

I am a polyglot, mostly out of necessity, adding English and German to my native Italian and, at the moment, learning Hebrew.

Ciao!
